An econometrics analysis paper to examine the effects of environmental qualities on housing rent in the USA

The paper examines the impact different environmental factors on housing rent in the USA. I used a multivariate regression model to predict the monthly rent mount based on various environmental characteristics (whether or not a neighborhood is polluted, having good schools, having good public transportation system, and having petty crime). The results show that the impact of living in areas near trash and living in areas having good schools is unclear. However, the impact of living in areas having good public transportation system and living in areas having petty crime is clear and significant.
